A migrated version of PluginEssentials (by @mvyasu) to Fusion 0.3.

The usage is similar to the previous version, except now every component requires a Scope table to use the components.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a repository with components that many people find essential to making plugins with [Fusion](https://github.com/Elttob/Fusion). You'll find in the src folder that there's two folders. Each one has a specific set of components which you can learn more about in the documentation.
