# Getting Started

Welcome to the tutorial section of Plugin Essentials!
<br>
Here, you will learn what you need to install it and how to install it.

## Requirements

To use Plugin Essentials, you need [Fusion](https://elttob.uk/Fusion/latest/).<br>
Fusion is the UI library that the components within Plugin Essentials are built with. So you must install it inside your plugin.

You can install Fusion wherever you want within your Plugin, Plugin Essentials will automatically find and use it.

## Installation

Installing Plugin Essentials is pretty easy! Just head over to this [link](https://github.com/TenebrisNoctua/PluginEssentials/releases/latest) to download the `.rbxm` file that contains the source code.

After the download, open Roblox Studio, go into `PluginDebugService` and right click on your Plugin instance, and select "Insert From File".

Select the `PluginEssentials.rbxm` file that you just downloaded, and if the `PluginEssentials` folder has appeared, congratulations, the installation is complete!
